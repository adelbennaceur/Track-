This is a dataset for self driving car simulation using the udacity SDC simulator, The images are taken using 3 differnt angles, you can a notice
a csv in the repo containing the steering angles of each iamge followed by the speed and throttle values, my goal is to create a NN model 
using this data to teach a car to drive itself.
